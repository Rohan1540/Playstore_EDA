📊 Google Play Store Data Analysis

Welcome to the Google Play Store Data Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset from the Google Play Store, offering insights into app categories, user ratings, installs, and more.

🔍 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of Google Play Store apps to uncover patterns and trends. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and interpretation of various app-related metrics.

🛠️ Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, standardized data formats, and cleaned columns like Size, Installs, and Price.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted descriptive statistics and visualized data to identify trends in app categories, install counts, and ratings.
Visualization: Created detailed plots and charts to illustrate key findings using matplotlib and seaborn.
📁 Dataset
The dataset includes:

App Details: Name, category, rating, reviews, size, installs, price, and more.
Time Information: Last updated date, categorized into day, month, and year.
📊 Analysis Highlights
Top App Categories: Explored the distribution of apps across different categories and identified the most popular ones.
Install Trends: Analyzed installation numbers to find the most installed apps and categories.
Rating Insights: Identified apps with top ratings and the factors contributing to high user satisfaction.
🖥️ Technologies Used
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Data Visualization: Used various plotting techniques to bring the data insights to life.
Data Wrangling: Cleaned and transformed raw data into a structured format for analysis.
📂 Output
The cleaned dataset is saved as googleplaystore_cleaned.csv and can be used for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
